## HR Employee Attrition Analysis

Cleaning and analysing HR Attrition data as well as creating an interactive report in PowerBI

## Introduction

HR Analytics helps us with interpreting organizational data. It finds the people-related trends in the data and allows the HR Department to take the appropriate steps to keep the organization running smoothly and profitably. Attrition in a corporate setup is one of the complex challenges that the people managers and the HRs personnel have to deal with.

## Tasks to Perform

1. Data Cleaning: deleting redundant columns, renaming the columns, dropping duplicates, cleaning individual columns, removing blank values from the dataset and check for some more transformations

2. Data Visualization 

## Report Requirement

While planning for this project the initial purpose of creating the report was to see the overall trend of attrition and employee distribution along each department of the organization. However, during the report design I was also interested in doing a root-cause analysis to identify patterns and factors influencing attrition.

## Conclusion

This was a fun project to work on. The insights were quite interesting to see and I'm glad I took on the project.
